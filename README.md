# Boulder Buddy

Boulder Buddy is a mobile-in-mind, web application designed completely in Figma for rock climbers to track their sessions in the gym. Start a new session and track the boulders you climb to eventually view meaningful statistics of you and other climbers you follow. The app was built in React utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript and deployed via Heroku. Open up Device Mode (optimized for Iphone 6/7/8 Plus) in your browser's dev tools to view the app in its intended form! Or check out the app on your smart phone or other device.
